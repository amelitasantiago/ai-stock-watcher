Key Technical Insights
Based on your training logs, several critical patterns emerge that warrant attention:
Model Performance Hierarchy
Your results clearly demonstrate ARIMA's dominance across all securities, achieving 26% lower RMSE than regression models and 36% lower than LSTM. This suggests that stock price movements in your dataset follow patterns well-captured by autoregressive integrated moving average processes, while the additional complexity of deep learning models may be introducing overfitting rather than meaningful signal capture.
Asset Class Predictability
The 44% performance advantage of ETFs (SPY, QQQ, IWM) over individual stocks reveals a fundamental insight: aggregate indices are significantly more predictable than individual securities. This aligns with financial theory - diversification reduces idiosyncratic noise, making trend patterns more discernible.
LSTM Underperformance Analysis
Your LSTM models consistently underperformed despite reasonable architecture choices (30-step sequences, early stopping, proper regularization). This pattern suggests either:

Insufficient non-linear signal in the preprocessed features
Sequence length mismatch with actual market memory
Architecture overcomplexity for the available signal-to-noise ratio

Critical Concerns
The consistently negative R¬≤ values in your regression models indicate that linear relationships between technical indicators and future returns are essentially absent. This is actually expected in efficient markets but highlights a fundamental limitation in the feature engineering approach.
Recommendation: Consider implementing prediction intervals and confidence bounds around your forecasts, particularly for TSLA which shows elevated prediction errors across all model types. The ensemble approach provides good diversification benefits, but the underlying model uncertainty remains substantial.
Your system appears ready for controlled deployment with appropriate risk management frameworks in place.

Background
The Problem
Financial markets are complex, driven by price patterns, economic indicators, and investor sentiment.
Traditional and single-model approaches offer limited, delayed, or non-transparent insights.
Retail investors lack tools that integrate multiple AI disciplines for a holistic view.

Background & Problem Statement
Financial markets are shaped by multiple complex factors including historical price patterns, economic indicators, company performance, and investor sentiment from news and events. Traditional forecasting methods struggle to capture these complexities, leaving investors with limited or delayed insights.


Current Limitations
Single-model approaches provide narrow perspectives
Lack of transparency in decision-making
Limited ability to handle uncertainty
Delayed integration of sentiment signals
Poor risk management frameworks
AI/ML Opportunity
Real-time data processing capabilities
Pattern recognition in complex datasets
Multi-modal information integration
Probabilistic reasoning under uncertainty
Cognitive-level decision support
